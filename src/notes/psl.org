This looks really similar to the [[./tsetlin.org][Tsetlin machine]], in the sense that
they both use something like disjunctive normal form to represent
clauses. I prefer this model because of the "continuous relaxtion" of
Boolean variables in to real numbers, allowing fuzzy inference. I get
the sense that the Tsetlin machine will be too sparse to do useful
learning, but the idea of searching the space of disjunctive normal
form is the key insight and is shared between the models.

This puts the previous model in the context of a Prolog-like logic
programming language, enhanced with probabilistic reasoning. I want to
make something like this in to a Denshi dialect.
